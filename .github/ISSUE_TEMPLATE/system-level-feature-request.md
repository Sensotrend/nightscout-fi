* Requirements check list *
Go through the list below, and either
- reference to requirements specified elsewhere -- most likely for categories a), and h) to l)
- specify the requirements for this feature explicitly -- most likely for categories b) to g)

a) functional and capability requirements;
NOTE 1 Examples include:
– performance (e.g., purpose of software, timing requirements),
– physical characteristics (e.g., code language, platform, operating system),
– computing environment (e.g., hardware, memory size, processing unit, time zone, network infrastructure) under
which the software is to perform, and
– need for compatibility with upgrades or multiple SOUP or other device versions.
b) SOFTWARE SYSTEM inputs and outputs;
NOTE 2 Examples include:
– data characteristics (e.g., numerical, alpha-numeric, format)
– ranges,
– limits, and
– defaults.
c) interfaces between the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and other SYSTEMS;
d) software-driven alarms, warnings, and operator messages;
e) SECURITY requirements;
NOTE 3 Examples include:
– those related to the compromise of sensitive information,
– authentication,
– authorization,
– audit trail, and
– communication integrity,
– system security/malware protection.
f) user interface requirements implemented by software;
NOTE 4 Examples include those related to:
– support for manual operations,
– human-equipment interactions,
– constraints on personnel, and
– areas needing concentrated human attention.
NOTE 5 Information regarding usability engineering requirements can be found in IEC 62366-1 [21] among others
(e.g., IEC 60601-1-6 [3]).
g) data definition and database requirements;
NOTE 6 Examples include:
– form;
– fit;
– function.
h) installation and acceptance requirements of the delivered MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE at the operation
and maintenance site or sites;
i) requirements related to methods of operation and maintenance;
j) requirements related to IT-network aspects;
NOTE 9 Examples include those related to:
– networked alarms, warnings, and operator messages;
– network protocols;
– handling of unavailability of network services.
k) user maintenance requirements; and
l) regulatory requirements.
NOTE 10 The requirements in a) through l) can overlap.
[Class A, B, C]
NOTE 7 All of these requirements might not be available at the beginning of the software development.
NOTE 8 Among others, ISO/IEC 25010 [12] provides information on quality characteristics that may be useful in
defining software requirements.

* Risk analysis *
Indicate when risk analysis based on the requirements has been performed, and by whom.
